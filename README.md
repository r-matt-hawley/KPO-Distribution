To help KPO (Kingwood Pops Orchestra) distribute sheet music for the convenience of its members and for ease in following copyright laws.

## User Groups
- Orhcestra Members who access music
- Scanners/Admin - might be separate groups
- Scanners add music according to parts (e.g, Trumpet I, Trumpet II, Flute I, Flute II, etc).
- Admins add, remove, and reassign orchestra members
- One person can hold multiple (or all) user groups

## Current Processes
After recieving music from a rental company, scanners take pictures of each page and upload them to google drive where we control permissions

## Requirements
- User roles should be easily transferrable, i.e, when the appropriate board members rotate on/off the board, their priviledges can be added or removed as appropriate
- Sheet music is stored by instrument part so that an orchestra member can view/print music or export to external application.
- Members should be able to view music of any part, but they can download only their own parts
- After each concert all permissions to view, etc. should be discontinued. 
- Users can view what pieces have been released by concert
    - Scanners view:
        - what pieces have been uploaded (Did we miss a part?)
        - what parts have been uploaded to each piece (Does this piece have English horn? What pieces have piccolo?)
    - Orchestra members view:
        - what pieces have "come in" from the rental companies
- Non programmers can manage the structure of the application within the scope of these requirements.

## New Processes
### Orchestra Member Registration
- KPO Board compiles list of members' emails
- Once a member registers an account, their email is matched to the list, and their part is assigned.
    - If a registrant's email does not match the member list, the application alerts admins via email
    - Admin should add new orchestra members to the member list before the member's first rehearsal.
    - TODO: Do we need to distribute music to ringers?
